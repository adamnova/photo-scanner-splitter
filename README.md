## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip
- (Optional) Ollama for location identification

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adamnova/photo-scanner-splitter.git
cd photo-scanner-splitter
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Process a single scanned image:

```bash
photo-splitter input.jpg -o output_photos
```

This will:
1. Detect all photos in `input.jpg`
2. Show a preview of detected photos with bounding boxes
3. For each photo, show a preview and ask for confirmation
4. Save accepted photos to `output_photos/` directory

### Batch Processing

Process all images in a directory:

```bash
photo-splitter scans/ -o output_photos
```

### Non-Interactive Mode

Process images without user interaction (useful for batch processing):

```bash
photo-splitter scans/ -o output_photos --no-interactive
```

### Disable Auto-Rotation

If you want to keep the original orientation:

```bash
photo-splitter input.jpg -o output_photos --no-rotate
```

### Enable Dust Removal

Clean up old photos with dust, scratches, and film grain using a quality-optimized algorithm:

```bash
photo-splitter input.jpg -o output_photos --dust-removal
```

This feature uses advanced image processing algorithms optimized for maximum quality:
- Bilateral filtering for edge-preserving noise reduction
- Non-local means denoising with enhanced parameters for superior quality
- Multi-scale morphological operations to detect dust at different sizes
- Adaptive thresholding for precise dust mask creation
- Navier-Stokes inpainting for highest quality restoration

### Deduplication

Remove duplicate images while keeping the highest quality version:

#### Source Image Deduplication

Deduplicate scanned images before processing (useful when processing directories with duplicate scans):

```bash
photo-splitter scans/ -o output_photos --deduplicate-source
```

This will:
1. Analyze all source images in the directory
2. Identify duplicates using perceptual hashing
3. Keep only the highest quality version of each duplicate set
4. Process only the unique images

#### Individual Photo Deduplication

Deduplicate extracted photos after splitting (removes duplicate photos within a scan):

```bash
photo-splitter input.jpg -o output_photos --deduplicate-photos
```

This will:
1. Extract all photos from the scan
2. Identify duplicate photos using perceptual hashing
3. Keep only the highest quality version of each duplicate
4. Save only the unique photos

#### Combined Deduplication

Use both deduplication options together for comprehensive duplicate removal:

```bash
photo-splitter scans/ -o output_photos --deduplicate-source --deduplicate-photos
```

**Quality Scoring**: When duplicates are detected, the tool keeps the highest quality version based on:
- Image resolution (width Ã— height)
- Sharpness (Laplacian variance)
- Brightness distribution

### Location Identification with Ollama

Identify the location where photos were taken using AI:

```bash
photo-splitter input.jpg -o output_photos --identify-location
```

This feature:
1. Requires [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) to be installed and running
2. Uses a vision-capable model (default: `qwen2.5-vl:32b`) to analyze photos
3. Saves location metadata in a separate text file alongside each photo
4. Works with any Ollama vision model

To use a different model or Ollama server:

```bash
photo-splitter input.jpg -o output_photos --identify-location \
  --ollama-url http://localhost:11434 \
  --ollama-model qwen2.5-vl:32b
```

**Note**: Make sure Ollama is running before using this feature. Install Ollama from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai) and pull a vision model:

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5-vl:32b
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
photo-splitter input.jpg -o output_photos --min-area 20000 --dust-removal --deduplicate-photos
```

- `--min-area`: Minimum area (in pixels) for a photo to be detected (default: 10000)
- `--no-rotate`: Disable automatic rotation detection and correction
- `--no-interactive`: Disable interactive preview and confirmation
- `--dust-removal`: Enable dust and scratch removal from photos
- `--deduplicate-source`: Enable deduplication of source images before processing
- `--deduplicate-photos`: Enable deduplication of extracted photos after splitting
- `--identify-location`: Enable location identification using Ollama LLM
- `--ollama-url`: URL of the Ollama API server (default: http://localhost:11434)
- `--ollama-model`: Ollama model to use for location identification (default: qwen2.5-vl:32b)

## Face Detection

The tool includes high-quality face detection powered by a deep learning ResNet SSD model. This can be used to detect people in images with high accuracy.

### Using Face Detection Programmatically

```python
from photo_splitter.detector import PhotoDetector
import cv2

# Initialize detector with custom face confidence threshold
detector = PhotoDetector(face_confidence=0.5)

# Load your image
image = cv2.imread('your_photo.jpg')

# Detect faces
faces = detector.detect_faces(image)

# Process results
for i, face in enumerate(faces, 1):
    x, y, w, h = face['bbox']
    confidence = face['confidence']
    print(f"Face {i}: Location ({x}, {y}) Size: {w}x{h} Confidence: {confidence:.2%}")
    
    # Draw rectangle around face
    cv2.rectangle(image, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)

# Save annotated image
cv2.imwrite('faces_detected.jpg', image)
```

### Face Detection Parameters

- **face_confidence**: Minimum confidence threshold (0.0 to 1.0, default: 0.5)
  - Lower values detect more faces but may include false positives
  - Higher values are more strict and only detect high-confidence faces

### Face Detection Model

The face detector uses OpenCV's DNN module with a pre-trained ResNet SSD model:
- **Model**: res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel
- **Architecture**: Single Shot Detector (SSD) with ResNet-10 backbone
- **Input Size**: 300x300 pixels
- **Accuracy**: High accuracy on frontal and near-frontal faces

The model is automatically downloaded on first use and cached in `~/.photo_splitter/`.

### Example Demo

Run the included face detection demo:

```bash
python examples/face_detection_demo.py
```

This will create a sample image with face-like patterns, detect them, and save an annotated result.

## How It Works

1. **Source Deduplication** (optional): Removes duplicate source images before processing, keeping the highest quality version
2. **Edge Detection**: Uses Canny edge detection to find edges in the scanned image
3. **Contour Finding**: Identifies closed contours that likely represent photo boundaries
4. **Filtering**: Filters contours by minimum area to exclude noise and small artifacts
5. **Extraction**: Extracts each detected photo using its bounding box
6. **Photo Deduplication** (optional): Removes duplicate extracted photos, keeping the highest quality version
7. **Dust Removal** (optional): Applies quality-optimized algorithms to clean dust and scratches:
   - Bilateral filtering for edge-preserving noise reduction
   - Non-local means denoising with enhanced quality parameters
   - Multi-scale morphological operations (3x3, 5x5, 7x7 kernels) to detect dust at different sizes
   - Adaptive thresholding for precise dust detection
   - Navier-Stokes inpainting algorithm for superior quality restoration
8. **Enhanced Rotation Detection**: Uses multiple strategies to reliably determine rotation:
   - Hough line detection analyzes dominant edge angles
   - Projection profile analysis detects text-like patterns
   - Confidence scoring ensures reliable results
   - Weighted combination of methods provides accurate angle estimation
9. **Alignment**: Rotates the photo to correct orientation if needed
10. **Location Identification** (optional): Uses Ollama LLM to identify where the photo was taken
11. **User Validation** (if interactive mode): Shows preview for user confirmation
12. **Saving**: Saves the processed photo with a descriptive filename and optional location metadata

## Examples

### Example 1: Family Photo Album Scan

You have scanned pages from a photo album where each scan contains 2-4 photos:

```bash
photo-splitter album_scans/ -o individual_photos
```

The tool will:
- Process each scan in the `album_scans/` directory
- Detect individual photos on each page
- Correct any rotation
- Save them as `scan1_photo_1.jpg`, `scan1_photo_2.jpg`, etc.

### Example 2: Quick Batch Processing

You have many scans and want to process them all without manual review:

```bash
photo-splitter large_scan_batch/ -o photos --no-interactive
```

### Example 3: Identify Photo Locations

You have old family photos and want to know where they were taken:

```bash
photo-splitter family_photos.jpg -o organized_photos --identify-location
```

The tool will:
- Detect and extract individual photos
- Use AI to analyze each photo and identify the location
- Save location information in text files like `family_photos_photo_1_location.txt`

### Example 4: Scanning Larger Photos

If you're scanning larger photos and the default minimum area is too small:

```bash
photo-splitter input.jpg -o output --min-area 50000
```

### Example 5: Restoring Old Photos with Dust

For vintage photos with dust and scratches:

```bash
photo-splitter old_album_scan.jpg -o restored_photos --dust-removal
```

### Example 6: Processing with Deduplication

When you have multiple scans of the same album pages or duplicate photos:

```bash
# Deduplicate source scans and extracted photos
photo-splitter album_scans/ -o unique_photos --deduplicate-source --deduplicate-photos --no-interactive
```

This will:
- Analyze all scans in the directory and remove duplicate scans (keeping highest quality)
- Extract photos from each unique scan
- Remove duplicate photos within and across scans (keeping highest quality)
- Save only unique, high-quality photos

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Scan Quality**: Use high-resolution scans (300 DPI or higher) for better detection
2. **Contrast**: Ensure good contrast between photos and background
3. **Background**: A uniform, light-colored background works best
4. **Spacing**: Leave some space between photos on the scanner bed
5. **Alignment**: Photos don't need to be perfectly aligned - rotation correction will handle small angles
6. **Dust Removal**: For best results with old photos, enable `--dust-removal` to clean up dust spots and scratches with quality-optimized algorithms
7. **Deduplication**: When processing directories with potential duplicates, use `--deduplicate-source` to save processing time and `--deduplicate-photos` to ensure only unique photos are saved

## Troubleshooting

### Photos not detected

- Try lowering the `--min-area` threshold
- Ensure there's good contrast between photos and background
- Check that photos aren't touching each other in the scan

### Incorrect rotation

- The enhanced rotation detection uses multiple strategies (edge detection and projection analysis) to handle various photo types
- Works best with photos that have clear horizontal or vertical edges, text, or regular patterns
- For photos with mostly diagonal content or artistic/abstract patterns, manual rotation may still be needed
- You can access the confidence score using the `detect_rotation_enhanced()` method in the API

### Too many false detections

- Increase the `--min-area` threshold
- Ensure the scanner bed is clean

result = detector.detect_rotation_enhanced(image)
print(f"Detected angle: {result['angle']:.2f}Â°")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.2f}")

# Simple rotation detection (backward compatible)
angle = detector.detect_rotation(image)
print(f"Angle: {angle:.2f}Â°")

# Rotate image
corrected = detector.rotate_image(image, -angle)

# Detect photos in a scan
photos = detector.detect_photos('scan.jpg')
for i, (contour, bbox) in enumerate(photos):
    extracted = detector.extract_photo('scan.jpg', contour, bbox)
